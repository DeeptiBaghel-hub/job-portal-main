# CareerNest

A full-stack MERN job portal that connects job seekers with recruiters. Job seekers can browse and filter jobs, apply, and track their applications; recruiters can register a company, post jobs, and manage applicants.

## Features

- JWT-based authentication with role-based access (**Student / Job Seeker** and **Recruiter**)
- Profile management with resume and profile-photo uploads (via Cloudinary)
- Company registration and management for recruiters
- Job posting, browsing, category filters, and search
- One-click job applications and application-status tracking
- Recruiter dashboard to view applicants and update application status

## Tech Stack

**Frontend** — `frontend/`
- React 19 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn-style UI components
- Redux Toolkit + Redux Persist for state management
- React Router v7, Axios

**Backend** — `backend/`
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing
- Multer + Cloudinary for file uploads (resumes, profile photos)

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A MongoDB connection string (local or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas))
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account (for file uploads)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeeptiBaghel-hub/job-portal-main.git
cd job-portal-main/Job-portal-main
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=8000
SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Run it:

```bash
npm run dev      # nodemon, auto-restarts on changes
# or
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set in `.env`:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Run it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

The repo ships with everything needed to deploy the backend to **Render** and the frontend to **Vercel**.

### 1. Backend on Render

1. Push the repo to GitHub (if not already).
2. In Render, choose **New → Blueprint** and point it at this repository. Render will detect `render.yaml` and configure the `job-portal-api` service automatically (root directory `backend`, build `npm ci`, start `npm start`, health check `/health`).
3. When prompted, set the secret environment variables:
   - `MONGO_URI`
   - `SECRET_KEY`
   - `CLOUD_NAME`
   - `API_KEY`
   - `API_SECRET`
   - `CLIENT_URL` — set this to your Vercel URL once you have it, e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`
4. Render supplies `PORT` automatically — you don't need to set it.
5. Deploy, then confirm it's healthy at `https://<your-render-service>.onrender.com/health`.

### 2. Frontend on Vercel

1. In Vercel, **Add New → Project** and import the same repository.
2. Configure the project:
   - **Root Directory:** `frontend`
   - **Install Command:** `npm ci`
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
3. Add the environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = `https://<your-render-service>.onrender.com` (no trailing slash)
4. Deploy. `frontend/vercel.json` is already set up to rewrite all routes to `index.html`, so React Router routes keep working on refresh/direct links.

### 3. Wire them together

Once both are live, go back to the Render service and update `CLIENT_URL` to your final Vercel domain, then redeploy the backend so CORS allows requests from the deployed frontend.

### 4. CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes/PRs to `main`/`master`, installing dependencies and checking the frontend build plus backend syntax. Connect Render's and Vercel's GitHub integrations so pushes to `main` auto-deploy once CI passes.

> Never commit real `.env` files — use the `.env.example` templates locally and set the actual values in the Vercel/Render dashboards.
